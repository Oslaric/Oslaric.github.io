Information Collection and Use

The BookThoughts app collects certain non-personal information solely for the purpose of enhancing user experience. The information collected includes the iOS version, hardware platform, and a device's unique identifier. None of this information pertains to personal privacy.

Log Data

When using the BookThoughts app, non-personal log data may be collected in case of errors. This log data includes information such as the device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, app configuration, usage timestamps, and other statistics.

Cookies

The BookThoughts app does not utilize cookies for any purpose. However, third-party code and libraries incorporated into the app may use cookies to enhance their services. Users have the option to accept or reject these cookies within their device settings.

Service Providers

The BookThoughts app may engage third-party companies and individuals to facilitate services, provide technical support, or analyze usage patterns. These service providers may access non-personal information for these purposes but are strictly prohibited from disclosing or using this information for any other reason.

Security

While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to safeguard non-personal information, it's important to note that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is entirely secure. Therefore, absolute security of data cannot be guaranteed.
